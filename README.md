# APB-Reloaded
Fixes for APB Reloaded on Unreal Engine 3.0
i will throw there a fixes i figureout as configs etc. to get rid of oof (out of memory), stutters, lagging mouse, etc. 

Final version of Shaders, I will not work anymore at them it will be waste of my time, Engine Upgrade is close. I will focus after 3.5 comes out ( propably at configs only - Matt Says to not edit other files so ;> )
